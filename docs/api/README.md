# API

`urql` is a collection of multiple packages. You'll likely be using one of the framework bindings
package or exchange packages, which are all listed in this section.

Most of these packages will refer to or use utilities and types from the `@urql/core` package. [Read
more about the core package on the "Core Package" page.](../concepts/core-package.md)
