# Subscriptions

One feature of `urql` that was not mentioned in the ["Basics" section](../basics/README.md) is `urql`'s
APIs and ability to handle GraphQL subscriptions.

## The Subscription Exchange

To add support for subscriptions we need to add the `subscriptionExchange` to our `Client`.

```js
import { Client, defaultExchanges, subscriptionExchange } from 'urql';

const client = new Client({
  url: '/graphql',
  exchanges: [
    ...defaultExchanges,
    subscriptionExchange({
      forwardSubscription,
    }),
  ],
});
```

[Read more about _Exchanges_ and how they work on the "Exchanges" page.](../concepts/exchanges.md)

In the above example, we add the `subscriptionExchange` to the `Client` with the default exchanges
add before it. The `subscriptionExchange` is a factory that accepts additional options and returns
the actual `Exchange` function. It does not make any assumption over the transport protocol and
scheme that is used. Instead, we need to pass a `forwardSubscription` function which is called with
an "enriched" _Operation_ every time the `Client` attempts to execute a GraphQL Subscription.

When we define this function it must return an "Observable-like" object, which needs to follow the
[Observable spec](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable), which comes down to having an
object with a `.subscribe()` method accepting an observer.

## Setting up `subscriptions-transport-ws`

If your GraphQL API is using [the Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/),
you'll be able to use [Apollo's `subscriptions-transport-ws`
package](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws).

```js
import { Client, defaultExchanges, subscriptionExchange } from 'urql';
import { SubscriptionClient } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';

const subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient('wss://localhost/graphql', { reconnect: true });

const client = new Client({
  url: '/graphql',
  exchanges: [
    ...defaultExchanges,
    subscriptionExchange({
      forwardSubscription(operation) {
        return subscriptionClient.request(operation);
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

In this example, we're creating a `SubscriptionClient`, are passing in a URL and some parameters,
and are using the `SubscriptionClient`'s `request` method to create a Subscription Observable, which
we return to the `subscriptionExchange` inside `forwardSubscription`.

[Read more about `subscription-transport-ws` on its README.](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/README.md)

## React & Preact

The `useSubscription` hooks comes with a similar API to `useQuery`, which [we've learned about in
the "Queries" page in the "Basics" section.](../basics/queries.md)

Its usage is extremely similar in that it accepts options, which may contain `query` and
`variables`. However, it also accepts a second argument, which is a reducer function, similar to
what you would pass to `Array.prototype.reduce`.

It receives the previous set of data that this function has returned or `undefined`.
As the second argument, it receives the event that has come in from the subscription.
You can use this to accumulate the data over time, which is useful for a
list for example.

In the following example, we create a subscription that informs us of
new messages. We will concatenate the incoming messages so that we
can display all messages that have come in over the subscription across
events.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useSubscription } from 'urql';

const newMessages = `
  subscription MessageSub {
    newMessages {
      id
      from
      text
    }
  }
`;

const handleSubscription = (messages = [], response) => {
  return [response.newMessages, ...messages];
};

const Messages = () => {
  const [res] = useSubscription({ query: newMessages }, handleSubscription);

  if (!res.data) {
    return <p>No new messages</p>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {res.data.map(message => (
        <p key={message.id}>
          {message.from}: "{message.text}"
        </p>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

As we can see, the `result.data` is being updated and transformed by
the `handleSubscription` function. This works over time, so as
new messages come in, we will append them to the list of previous
messages.

## One-off Subscriptions

When you're using subscriptions directly without `urql`'s framework bindings, you can use the `Client`'s `subscription` method for one-off subscriptions. This method is similar to the ones for mutations and subscriptions [that we've seen before on the "Core Package" page.](../concepts/core-package.md#one-off-queries-and-mutations)

This method will always [returns a Wonka stream](../concepts/stream-patterns.md#the-wonka-library) and doesn't have a `.toPromise()` shortcut method, since promises won't return the multiple values that a subscription may deliver. Let's convert the above example to one without framework code, as we may use subscriptions in a Node.js environment.

```js
import { pipe, subscribe } from 'wonka';

const newMessages = `
  subscription MessageSub {
    newMessages {
      id
      from
      text
    }
  }
`;

const { unsubscribe } = pipe(
  client.subscription(MessageSub),
  subscribe(result => {
    console.log(result); // { data: ... }
  })
);
```
