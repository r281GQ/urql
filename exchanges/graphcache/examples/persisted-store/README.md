## About

This is a basic example of store-persistence being used with `urql`.

## Usage

#### 1. Install dependencies in repo root.

To get started with the example, make sure to install `graphcache`'s dependencies in the root directory of your clone. We `link` to the source from the `examples` directory, so its dependencies need to be installed.

```bash
# In root directory
yarn
```

#### 2. Navigate to this directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd examples/persisted-store
yarn
```

#### 3. Start the example app and server (this is done in a single command).

```bash
yarn start
```

#### 4. Open your browser

Navigate to the example at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

(A GraphQL backend will also run at [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)).
